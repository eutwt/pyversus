`pyversus` (imported as `versus`) is a Python package that mirrors the the original R library while pushing
all heavy work into DuckDB. Use it to compare two duckdb relations (tables or
views) or pandas/polars DataFrames without materializing them. The `compare()`
function gives a `Comparison` object that shows where the tables disagree, with
methods for displaying the differences.

> **Alpha status:** This package is in active development. Backward compatibility
> is not guaranteed between releases yet.

## Installation

Install from PyPI (wheels are available for Python 3.7+):

```bash
pip install pyversus
```

That command installs DuckDB, the only runtime dependency.

## Quick start

Here is a small interactive session you can paste into a Python REPL:

```{python}
from versus import compare, examples

rel_a = examples.example_cars_a()
rel_b = examples.example_cars_b()

comparison = compare(rel_a, rel_b, by="car")
comparison
```

A comparison includes:

- `comparison.intersection`: columns in both tables with counts of differing values
- `comparison.unmatched_cols`: columns in only one table
- `comparison.unmatched_rows`: rows in only one table with counts per table

Use `value_diffs()` to see the values that are different.

```{python}
comparison.value_diffs("disp")
```

Use `value_diffs_stacked()` to compare multiple columns at once.

```{python}
comparison.value_diffs_stacked(["mpg", "disp"])
```

Use `weave_diffs_*()` to see the differing values in context.

```{python}
comparison.weave_diffs_wide(["mpg", "disp"])
```

```{python}
comparison.weave_diffs_long("disp")
```

Use `slice_diffs()` to get the rows with differing values from one table.

```{python}
comparison.slice_diffs("a", "mpg")
```

> Note: The `column` argument only decides which diffs include a row; the returned relation
> always keeps the full schema of the requested table.

Use `slice_unmatched()` to get the unmatched rows from one table.

```{python}
comparison.slice_unmatched("b")
```

Use `slice_unmatched_both()` to get the unmatched rows from both tables.

```{python}
comparison.slice_unmatched_both()
```

Use `summary()` to see what kind of differences were found.

```{python}
comparison.summary()
```

## Usage

- Call `compare()` with DuckDB relations or pandas/polars DataFrames. If
  your relations live on a custom DuckDB connection, pass it via `con=`
  so the comparison queries use the same database.
- The `by` columns must uniquely identify rows in each table. When they
  do not, `compare()` raises `ComparisonError` and tells you which key
  values repeat.
- The resulting `Comparison` object stores only metadata and row
  identifiers. Whenever you ask for actual rows (`value_diffs`, slices,
  weave helpers, etc.), the library runs SQL in DuckDB and returns the
  results as DuckDB relations, so you can inspect huge tables without
  blowing up Python memory.
- Need insight into the inputs? `comparison.inputs` exposes a mapping
  from table id (e.g., `"a"`, `"b"`) to the input relations.
- Need the row identifiers for unmatched rows? `comparison.unmatched_keys`
  exposes the table id plus `by` columns for those keys.
- Inputs stay lazy as well: `compare()` never materialises the full
  source tables in Python.
- Want to kick the tires quickly? The `versus.examples.example_cars_*`
  helpers used in the quick start are available for ad-hoc testing.

### Materialization

When you call `compare()`, Pyversus defines summary tables for the printed
output (`tables`, `by`, `intersection`, `unmatched_cols`, `unmatched_rows`).
These are relation-like wrappers that materialize themselves on print.
The input tables are never materialized by Pyversus in any mode; they stay
as DuckDB relations and are queried lazily.

In full materialization, Pyversus also builds a diff table: a single
relation with the `by` keys plus one boolean flag per value column
indicating a difference. The table only includes rows with at least one
difference. Those precomputed flags let row-level helpers fetch the
differing rows quickly via joins. Other modes skip the diff table and detect
differences inline.

- `materialize="all"`: store the summary tables and the diff table as temp
  tables. This is fastest if you will call row-level helpers multiple times.
- `materialize="summary"`: store only the summary tables. Row-level helpers
  run inline predicates and return lazy relations.
- `materialize="none"`: do not store anything up front. Printing the
  comparison materializes the summary tables.

Row-level helper outputs are always returned as DuckDB relations and are
never materialized automatically; materialize them explicitly if needed.

The package exposes the same high-level helpers as the R version
(`value_diffs*`, `weave_diffs*`, `slice_*`), so if you already know the
R API you can continue working the same way here.
